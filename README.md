Software implementation of the randomized GNN model presented in the paper [Pyramidal Reservoir Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04710) by [Filippo Maria Bianchi](https://sites.google.com/view/filippombianchi/home), Claudio Gallicchio, and Alessio Micheli.

## Downstream tasks

### Graph classification

The graph classification experiments can be reproduced by running the script [main_class.py](https://github.com/FilippoMB/Pyramidal-Reservoir-Graph-Neural-Networks/blob/master/main_class.py).

### Dimensionality reduction and visualization

The embeddings generated by the GNN model can be visualized with the script [main_lda.py](https://github.com/FilippoMB/Pyramidal-Reservoir-Graph-Neural-Networks/blob/master/main_lda.py), which uses Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to project the embeddings into a lower-dimensional space.
